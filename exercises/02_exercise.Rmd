# Overview
In this exercise you will analyze emission of methane from pig slurry samples incubated in a laboratory experiment.
Multiple bottles were used as reactors in a completely crossed factorial experiment with 2 temperatures and 2 headspace gases.
Measurement data were kindly provided by Frederik Dalby.

# 1. Read and check data
Read in the data in the file `slurry_emis.csv`.
Check the data.
The relevant columns are 

* `reactor` bottle key
* `ch4` methane concentration in bottle exhaust
* `flow` rate of gas flow through the bottle
* `day` time of measurement from setup
* `gas` headspace gas
* `temp` incubation temperature

# 2. Data analysis
Use an appropriate approach to determine if the data show that incubation temperature and headspace gas affect methane emission.
Quantify any effect.
